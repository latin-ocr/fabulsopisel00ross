THE TRANsrAnoN of these select Fables of
lissop, made above sixty years ago by H. Clarke, ,
and forming the ground work of nus, WaS‚ for the
time in which it was published, without disputc‚·
excellent3 but the changeS, which the diction of

In this edition, or, TRANSLAnoN, much &ire
and pains have been taken to discover, and remove
the inaccuraeies‚ and errors ’ which had crept into
” the Latin and English texts of even the best &db-2
tions of Mr. Clarke's AEsop}
